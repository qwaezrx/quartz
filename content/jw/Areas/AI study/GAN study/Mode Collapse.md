>Mode collapse happens when the generator can only produce a single type of output or a small set of outputs.


Mode collapse may happen due to problems in training, such as the generator finding a type of data that is easily able to fool the discriminator and thus keeps generating that one type. Because there is no incentive for the generator to switch things up, the entire system will over-optimize on that one output.
