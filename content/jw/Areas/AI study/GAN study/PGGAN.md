- Paper : [Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) (2018 / Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, Jaakko Lehtinen)


PGGAN progressively grows the generator and discriminator, starting from low resolution and adding layers to model finer details, resulting in faster and more stable training and producing high-quality images.
