## Reasoning and action
ReAct enables [[LLM]]s to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions.

The approach demonstrates superior performance over baselines in various tasks, overcoming issues like hallucination and error propagation.

ReAct outperforms imitation and RL methods in interactive decision making, even with minimal context examples.

It not only enhances performance but also improves interpretability, trustworthiness, and diagnosability by allowing humans to distinguish between internal knowledge and external information.
