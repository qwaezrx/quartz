- [**Chain-of-thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf) - Paper by researchers at Google exploring how chain-of-thought prompting improves the ability of LLMs to perform complex reasoning.
    
- [**PAL: Program-aided Language Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10435) - This paper proposes an approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps.
    
- [**ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) This paper presents an advanced prompting technique that allows an LLM to make decisions about how to interact with external applications.
