#Organizing 

[The PARA Method: How I Organize my Digital Information](https://www.lucapallotta.com/para/)
# 4 Primary Categories

- ### [[Project]]
	- Short term efforts your work or life that you're working on now.
- ### [[Area]]
	- Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time
- ### [[Resource]]
	- Topics or interests that may be useful in the future
- ### [[Archive]]
	- Inactive items from the other three categories

## 1. Projects
> __Goals__ to be achieved by a deadline

You have __projects__ you're actively working on, short-term efforts that you take on with a certain goal in mind. For example:
- Finish Coursera meta back-end course
- Complete webpage design
## 2. Area
> __Standard__ that has to be maintained indefinitely

You have __areas__ of responsibility which refers to important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention. These might include:
- Personal responsibilities such as Health, Finances.
- Work responsibilities such as Development, Study, Product Management.
## 3. Resource

You have range of topics you're interested in and learning about, such as:
- Programming
- OS
- Network
- Database
- Neuroscience
- Psychology
- Note taking
- Design
## 4. Archive
__Archives__, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active, but you might want to save for future reference:
- Projects you've completed or put on hand
- Areas that are no longer active or relevant
- Resources that you're no longer interested in

# The Key Principle - Organizing Information by your Projects and Goals
Instead of organizing information according to broad subjects like in school, organize it according to the __projects__ and __goals__ you are committed to right now. This is what it means to "organize by actionability"

# Summary of P.A.R.A. System
- Projects always fall into Areas
- Breaking down your areas of responsibility into clearly articulated projects allows you to
	- Know the extent of your commitments
	-  Connect your current efforts to your long-term goals
	-  Know if you're making progress towards your goals
- Areas of Responsibility include:
	- The roles you take on in life and the hats you wear (Team Leader, Mother/Father)
	- The ongoing standards where the buck stops with you (Product Development)
	- Things that take a certain amount of constant attention (Finance, Health)
- Resources include:
	- Interests (painting, design)
	- Themes (psychology, computer science)
	- Assets (stock photos, code snippets, typography links)
- Another useful guideline is to put __personally relevant__ information in Areas, and __generally useful__ information in Resources.
- You can connect Areas and Resources by inserting links in Area notes pointing to Resource notes
- Don't confuse hobbies and dreams with projects and goals
	- A project without a corresponding goal is "hobby"
	- A goal without a corresponding project is a "dream"

# 3 Core Principles
## 1. The magic number four
- Hierarchy is four categories wide (projects, areas, resources, archives)
- Hierarchy is no more than four levels deep (application -> stacks -> notebooks -> notes)
- Prevents the two primary sins of organizational overengineering: too many categories, and too many levels of hierarchy
## 2. Mirror your task management and project management systems perfectly
- This allows you to leverage the strengths of different applications rather than constantly searching for the one perfect application for your productivity system
## 3. Separate actionable from non-actionable items
- This allows for progressive disclosure--only showing the user as much information as they need in that moment--to minimize cognitive load
# Just-In-Time Organization
- Perform organizational work opportunistically, as opportunities arise, instead of pedantically, or "just because"
- Don't schedule reorganization on a strict timeline at set intervals (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- Make changes to your organizational structure in small batches.
- "Organizing things" represents time-consuming overhead work with no clear return or impact
## Flows and Upkeep
	PARA is a dynamic system (information flows between the four categories)
- From Projects
	- ðŸ‘‰ Areas: 
		A project can become a long-term, ongoing responsibility
	- ðŸ‘‰ Resources: 
		Scan the "intermediate work" (brainstorms, notes, background research, diagrams, interview notes, etc.) generated during a project that may be useful for future projects
	- ðŸ‘‰ Archives: 
		Moving completed or inactive projects to Archives for future reference
- From Areas
	- ðŸ‘‰ Projects:
		Information you've been collecting may be useful to a new project you started
	- ðŸ‘‰ Resources:
		If you realize a note that you thought was only relevant to you can also provide value to others
	- ðŸ‘‰ Archives:
		Archiving an area that ceases to be active (this applies to relationships)
- From Resources
	- ðŸ‘‰ Projects:
		An interest can become a full-blown project (one of the primary use cases for resource notebooks)
	- ðŸ‘‰ Areas:
		When you realize a piece of information in a resource notebook could apply to an area of responsibility in the life
	- ðŸ‘‰ Archives:
		If you lose interest in a topic over time, archive the information to avoid cluttering your workspace
- From Archives
	- ðŸ‘‰ Projects:
		Restarting an inactive project, or transferring useful information from past projects to use in current and future projects (one of the primary reasons to keep archive projects)
	- ðŸ‘‰ Areas:
		When information you collected a long time ago because relevant for a new responsibility you're taking on
	- ðŸ‘‰ Resources:
		When a past project becomes an interest (moving relevant notes from the archived project to a new resource section)
