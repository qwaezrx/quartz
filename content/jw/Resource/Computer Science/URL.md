## Uniform Resource Locator

>URL is a text string that specifies where a resource (such as a [[Web page]], image, or video) can be found on the [[Internet]].

In the context of [[HTTP]], URLs are called "Web address" or "link". Your [[Browser]] displays URLs in its address bar. Some browsers display only the part of a URL after the "//", that is the [[Domain name]].

URLs can also be used for file transfer ([[FTP]]), emails ([[SMTP]]), and other applications.
