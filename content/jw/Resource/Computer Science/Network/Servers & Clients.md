## Introduction
It's important to understand the concepts of [[Server]]s and [[Client]]s. The simplest way to think of a __[[Server]]__ is as something that provides data to something requesting that data which is __[[Client]]__.

Not only different nodes but individual programs running on the same node can be servers and clients to each other too.

>[!Important]
>Most devices are not purely server or client. Almost all nodes are both at the same time.

That all being said in most network topographies, each node is primarily either a server or a client. Sometimes we refer to an email server as an email server, even though itself is a client of a DNS server. Why? because its primary reason for existing is to serve data to clients.
