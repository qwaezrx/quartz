All the devices connected to a hub will end up talking to all other devices at the same time. It's up to each system connected to the hub to determine if the incoming data was for them or to ignore if it isn't. This causes a lot of noice on the network and creates what's called a __[[Collision domain]]__.

It is the primary reason hubs are very rare. They're mostly a historical artifact today.
