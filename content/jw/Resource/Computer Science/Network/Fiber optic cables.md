Fiber cables contain individual optic fibers which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair. These tubes of glass can transport beams of light.

Unlike copper, which uses electronic voltages, fiber cables use pulses of light to represent the 1s and 0s. Fiber can be used in environments where there's a lot of electromagnetic interference from outside sources.

Fiber cables can generally transport data quicker than copper cables can, but they're much more expensive and fragile. Fiber can also transport data over much longer distances than copper can without suffering potential data loss.
