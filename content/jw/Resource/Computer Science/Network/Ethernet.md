- Ethernet and the [[Data link layer]] provide a means for [[Software]] at higher levels of the stack to send and receive data.
- Per the [[OSI model]] , Ethernet provides services up to and including the [[Data link layer]].
- Ethernet is widely used in homes and industry, and interworks well with [[Wi-Fi]] technologies. The [[IP]] is commonly carried over Ethernet and so it is considered one of the key technologies that make up the [[Internet]].
## Modern Ethernet
Modern Ethernet variants use [[Twisted pair Ethernet]] and [[Fiber optic]] links in conjunction with [[Switch]]s.
