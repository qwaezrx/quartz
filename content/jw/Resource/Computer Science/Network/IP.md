## Internet Protocol
IP addresses are a 32-bit long numbers made up of four [[Octet]]s and each octet is normally described in [[Decimal]] numbers.

>[!important]
>IP addresses are distributed in large sections to various organizations and companies instead of being determined by hardware vendors.
>-> IP addresses are more hierarchical and easier to store data about  about.

For example:
- IBM owns every single IP that has the number 9 as the first octet.

>[!important]
>IP addresses belong to networks, not to the devices attached to those networks

On many modern networks, you can connect a new device and an IP address will be assigned to it automatically through a technology known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. An IP address assigned this way is known as dynamic IP address. The opposite of static IP address, which must be configured on a node manually.

In most cases, [[Static IP address]]es are reserved for [[Server]]s and network devices while [[Dynamic IP address]]es are reserved for [[Client]]s. 

## Sections
IP addresses can be split into two sections, which are split by [[Address class]]:
- [[Network ID]]
- [[Host ID]]
