>A [[Data link layer]] device that allows for connections from many to many computer at once. Also can inspect the contents of the [[Ethernet]] protocol data being sent around the network.

A switch is very similar to a [[Hub]], since you can connect many devices to it so they can communicate. 

>[!Hubs and switches]
>The primary device used to connect computer on a single network, usually referred to as a [[LAN]] or local area network

The difference is that while hub is layer 1 or __Physical layer__ device, a switch is a layer 2 or __[[Data link layer]]__ device. So it can determine which system the data is intended for and then only send that data to that one system by inspecting the [[Ethernet]] protocol data.
