## Introduction

The 1st layer in TCP/IP model in [[Network]].

In some ways, the physical layer of our network stack model is the most complex of all. It's main focus is on moving 1s & 0s from one end of the link to the next.

## Moving bits across the wire

It consists of devices and means of transmitting bits across computer networks.

>[!Bit]
>A __bit__ is a smallest representation of data that a computer can understand: it's a one or a zero

These ones and zeros sends across networks at the lowest level are what make up the __frames__ and __packets__ of data.

## Modulation

When a standard copper network cable connects to devices on both ends, will carry a constant electric charge. 1s & 0s are sent across those network cables through a process called __modulation__.

>[!Modulation]
>A way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable

When used for computer networks, this kind of modulation is more specifically known as __line coding__. It allows devices on either end of a link to understand that an electrical charge in a certain state is a zero and another state is one.

## Summary

Through this modulation technique, modern networks are capable of moving 10 billion 1s & 0s across a single network cable every second.
