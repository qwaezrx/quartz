A network interface card (NIC) is a [[Hardware]] component without which a [[Computer]] cannot be connected over a [[Network]]. It is a circuit board installed in a computer that provides a dedicated network connection to the computer. 

It is also called as:
- Network Interface Controller
- [[Network]] Adapter
- [[LAN]] adapter

## Purpose
- NIC allows both wired and wireless communications.
- NIC allows communications between computers connected via local area network [[LAN]] as well as communications over large-scale network through Internet Protocol [[IP]].
- NIC is both a [[Physical layer]] and a [[Data link layer]] device, i.e. it provides the necessary hardware circuitary so that the physical layer processes and some data link layer processes can run on it.

## Types of NIC cards

- ### Internal Network Cards
	- In internal network cards, motherboard has a slot for the network card where it can be inserted. It requires network cables to provide network access.
	- Internal network cards are of two types:
		1. Uses Peripheral Component Interconnect ([[PCI]]) connection
		2. Uses Industry Standard Architecture ([[ISA]])

- ### External Network Cards
	- In desktops and laptops that do not have an internal NIC, external NICs are used. External network cards are of two types:
		1. Wireless  based
			- Wireless network cards needs to be inserted into the [[Motherboard]].
		2. [[USB]] based.
	- No network cable is required to connect to the network.
	- Useful while traveling or accessing a wireless signal.
