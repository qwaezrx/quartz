[[Physical port]]s mounted in a wall or underneath your desk are generally connected to the network via cables ran through the walls which eventually end at a patch panel.

Additional cables are ran towards from a patch panel to [[Switch]]s or [[Router]]s to provide network access to the computers at the other end of those links.
