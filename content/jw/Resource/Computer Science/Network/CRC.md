## Cyclical Redundancy Check

>An important concept for data integrity, and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions

CRC is basically a mathematical transformation that uses polynomial division to create a number that represents a larger set of data.

Anytime you perform a CRC against a set of data, you should end up with the same [[Checksum]] number.
