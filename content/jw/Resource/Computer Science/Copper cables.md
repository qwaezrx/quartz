Copper cables are the most common form of networking cable. They're made up of multiple pairs of copper wires inside plastic insulator.

The sending device communicates binary data across these copper wires by changing the __voltage__ between two ranges. The system at the receiving end is able to interpret these voltage changes as binary 1s and 0s which  can then be translated into different forms of data.

> The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are __Cat5__, __Cat5e__, and __Cat6__ cables.


The important thing is that differences in how the twisted pairs are arranged inside these cables can drastically alter how quickly data can be sent across them. And how resistant these signals are to outside interference.

Higher level protocols have methods for detecting missing data and asking for the data a second time. Of course, this takes up more time.

- __Cat5e__ cable: Less likely that data needs to be re-transmitted compared to __Cat5__ cable.
- __Cat6__ cable: 
	- Follow even more strict specification to avoid __Crosstalk__ making it more expensive.
	- Can transfer data faster and more reliably than __Cat5e__ cables can, but because of their internal arrangement, they have a shorter maximum distance when used at higher speeds.
