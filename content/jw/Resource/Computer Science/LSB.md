In computer science and digital systems, the term "least significant bit" (LSB) refers to the lowest-order(__rightmost__) bit within a binary representation of a number. The binary representation of a number is composed of individual bits, each representing a power of 2. 

>The least significant bit holds the smallest value within the binary representation.

For example:
- 11010101 -> LSB is 1
- 11010100 -> LSB is 0
