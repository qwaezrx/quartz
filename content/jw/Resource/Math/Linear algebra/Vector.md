>Vector, in [[Mathematics]], a quantity that has both magnitude and direction but no position.

Vectors are usually indicated by a boldface letter, such as v. A vector’s magnitude, or length, is indicated by |v|, or _v_, which represents a one-dimensional quantity (such as an ordinary number) known as a [[Scalar]]. Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes the vector's magnitude but not its direction

Two vectors can be added or subtracted.

#### Basic vectors

$\hat{i}, \hat{j}$ are the "basic vectors" of the $xy$ coordinate system

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
4
\end{bmatrix} = (3)\hat{i} + (4)\hat{j}
$$

$\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$ are the "basic vectors" of the $xyz$ coordinate system


#### Linear combination

"Linear combination" of $\vec{v}. \vec{w}$:
$a\vec{v} + b\vec{w}$

#### Span
The "span" of $\vec{v}, \vec{w}$ is the set of all their linear combinations
