## Introduction
A mock API imitates the real [[API]] endpoint with fake data so that the client application developers can start development before the actual API is developed.

In mock API outputs, the data structure remains correct, but the values are fake. And you don't do any kind of business logic process for these mock data. You just return some pre-generated hard-coded data as a response.

## How it works
Mock API allows both API developers and the client application developers to evaluate the output and instantly understand what data they will get from an API call or what data they should deliver.

There are two major steps involved in creating Mock APIs.
1. You create mock data that you can deliver from the mock API endpoints.
2. Create mock API endpoints and serve those data.
