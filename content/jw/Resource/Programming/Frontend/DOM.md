>DOM is the data representation of the objects that comprises the structure and content of a document on the web.

## Document Object Model

DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as __nodes__ and __objects__. This way, programming languages can interact with the page.

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the [[Browser]] window or as the [[HTML]] source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the [[Web page]], it can be modified with a scripting language such as [[JavaScript]].
