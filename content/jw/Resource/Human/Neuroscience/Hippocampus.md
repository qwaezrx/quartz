## Introduction
The hippocampus is a paired structure present in each [[Temporal lobe]] of the [[Brain]]. It takes its name from the Greek word for the seahorse.

The hippocampus is part of a larger structure of the [[Temporal lobe]] called the [[Hippocampal formation]]. The hippocampal formation is a major part of the [[Limbic system]] and it is composed of three main parts:
- Hippocampus
- [[Dentate gyrus]]
- [[Subiculum]]

- Different areas of hippocampus are related to different types of memories. For example, the rear part of the hippocampus is involved in the processing of [[Spacial memory]].
## Functions
