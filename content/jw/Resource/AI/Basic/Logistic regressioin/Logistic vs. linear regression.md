There are two main forms of regression analysis. [[Linear regression]] has a continuous set of results that can be easily be mapped on a graph as a straight line. For example, if you want to determine the likelihood that the number of books someone reads affects how much money they make, linear regression would be the best equation to use.

[[Logistic regression]]s are non-linear and are portrayed on a graph with a curved shape called a [[Sigmoid]]. Instead of a continuous set of results, a logistical regression has two or more categories for data. If you want to learn the probability of getting a job based on how many applications you submit, whether you get a job is a discrete number of variables. Therefore, you would use a logistic regression program for that data.
