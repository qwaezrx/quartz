#### Sampling in Generative Models
- Generating the data that we want using the _Sampler_.


## Random sampling
Selecting data points from a dataset at random to get an unbiased sample of the data

## Temperature in sampling
Controlling the randomness in random sampling. A higher temperature will lead to a more random sample, a lower [[Temperature]] to a more focused sample

## Greedy decoding
An algorithmic approach that makes locally optimal choices at each stage to find a global solution. It chooses the best option at each step and does not reconsider previous choices
