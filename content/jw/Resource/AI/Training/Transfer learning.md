## Introduction
Transfer learning is a technique in [[ML]] where a [[Pre-trained model]] is used as a starting point for a new task, rather than training a new model from scratch

Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model, removing it's output layer, and adding a new output layer that is specific to the new task.

## Advantages of transfer learning
- Reduce training time
- Improve predictions
- Allow you to use smaller datasets

## When to use transfer learning
- Task A and B have the same input x
- You have a lot more data for Task A than Task B
- Low level features from A could be helpful for learning B
