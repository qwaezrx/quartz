Models that uses both encoder and decoder of the [[Transformer]] architecture.

One of the main encoder-decoder methods is Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer([[T5]])

T5 employs a "text-to-text" approach, which means that it transforms both the input and output data into a standardized text format. This allows T5 to be trained on a wide range of [[NLP#Tasks in NLP]].
