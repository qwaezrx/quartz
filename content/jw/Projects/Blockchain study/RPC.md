In _distributed computing_, a _remote procedure call (RPC)_ is when a computer program causes a procedure ([[subroutine]]) to execute in a different _address space_ (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is written as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly writing the details for the remote interaction.

- The programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote.
- A form of _client-server interaction_, typically implemented via a request-response message-passing system.
