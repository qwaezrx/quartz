[[Node]] operators can add a _validator_ to their [[Consensus client|consensus clients]] by depositing 32 [[ETH]] in the deposit contract. The validator client comes bundled with the consensus client and can be added to a node at any time. 

The validator handles:
- attestations
- block proposals

They enable a node to accrue rewards or lose ETH via penalties or slashing. Running the validator software also makes a node eligible to be selected to propose a new block.
