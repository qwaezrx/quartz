_Solidity_ is an _object-oriented_, high-level language for implementing [[Smart Contract|smart contracts]].

- Designed to target [[EVM]].
- Influenced by [[C++]], [[Python]], [[JavaScript]].
- Statically typed
- Supports:
	- inheritance
	- libraries
	- complex user-defined types
	- etc.
- Can create contracts such as:
	- voting
	- crowdfunding
	- blind auctions
	- multi-signature wallets

## Solidity Keywords
---
`public`: automatically generates a function that allows you to access the current value of the state variable from outside the contract. 

```
address public minter;
```

The code of the function generated by the compiler is equivalent to the following:

```
function minter() external view returns (address) { return minter; }
```

## Solidity Types
---
`address`: 160-bit value that does not allow any arithmetic operations

`mapping(KeyType KeyName? => ValueType ValueName?)`
