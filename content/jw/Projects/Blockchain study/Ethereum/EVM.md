  - Ethereum Virtual Machine

The _EVM_'s physical instantiation can't be described in the same way that one might point to a _cloud_ or an _ocean wave_, but it does exit as one single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running an [[Ethereum]] client.

The Ethereum protocol itself exist solely for the purpose of keeping the continuous, uninterrupted, and immutable operation of this special state machine. It's the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. At any given block in the chain, Ethereum has one and only one '__canonical__' state, and the _EVM_ is what defines the rules for computing a new valid state from block to block.
