Turing completeness is a term in computer science that describes the ability of a system to compute any possible calculation or program, and can be used to describe modern programming languages (Python, C++, etc).

_Turing complete_ describes a programmable system that can solve any computational problem. The concept comes from the Turing machine. Conversely, a non-Turing-complete system is limited to performing particular tasks based on pre-defined instructions.

A common analogy is that a pocket calculator is non-Turing complete because it's only programmed to perform a limited set of mathematical calculations. However, with a home computer, it's possible to write a program that will carry out the same task autonomously

[[Bitcoin]] and [[Ethereum]] provide the best-known contrast for Turing completeness. _Bitcoin_, and its Script programming language, was designed as a non-Turing complete system with limited functionality. The _Bitcoin_ software was programmed solely to process bitcoin transactions and cannot support complex, multi-step smart contract logic.

However, _Ethereum_ allows developers to write code using the Turing complete [[Solidity]] programming language, and executed it using the [[EVM|Ethereum Virtual Machine]], which is also Turing complete. Theoretically, it's possible to write any program for any use case and run it on Ethereum.

As such, Turing completeness has important implications for what can be achieved using blockchain technology.
