A _DAO_ is a collectively-owned, blockchain-governed organization working towards a shared mission.

DAOs allow us to work with like-minded folks around the globe without trusting a benevolent leader to manage the funds or operations. There is no CEO who can spend funds on a whim or CFO who can manipulate the books. Instead, blockchain-based rules baked into the code define how the organization works and how funds are spent.

They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice, and everything happens transparently on-chain.


## Why do we need DAOs?

Starting an organization with someone that involves funding and money requires a lot of trust in the people you're working with. But it's hard to trust someone you've only ever interacted with on the internet. With DAOs you don't need to trust anyone else in the group, just the DAO's code, which is 100% transparent and verifiable by anyone.
