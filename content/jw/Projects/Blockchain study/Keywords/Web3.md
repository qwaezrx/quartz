### Web 2.0: Read-Write (2004-now)

_Web2_ refers to the version of the [[Internet]] most of us know today. An internet dominated by companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data. _Web3_ in the context of [[Ethereum]], refers to decentralized apps that run on the [[Blockchain|blockchain]]. These are apps that allow anyone to participate without monetising their personal data.

## Web 3.0: Read-Write-Own

Web3 has become a catch-all term for the vision of a new, better internet. At its core, Web3 users [[Blockchain|blockchains]], [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]], and [[NFT|NFTs]] to give power back to the users in the form of ownership.

### Core ideas of Web3
Although it's challenging to provide a rigid definition of what Web3 is, a few core principles guide its creation.
- __Web3 is decentralized__: instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities, ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users.
- __Web3 is permissionless__: everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded.
- __Web3 has native payments__: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.
- __Web3 is trustless__: it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties.

## Why Web3?
---
Many Web3 developers have chosen to build apps because of decentralization:
- Anyone who is on the network has permission to use the service - or in other words, permission isn't required.
- No one can block you or deny you access to the service.
- Payments are built in via the native token, such as [[ETH]].
- Ethereum is [[Turing-complete]], meaning you can program pretty much anything.

### Ownership
Web3 allows for direct ownership through [[NFT|NFTs]]. No one has the power to take away your ownership. And, if you stop playing, you can sell or trade your in-game items on open markets and recoup their value.

### Censorship Resistance
The power of dynamic between platforms and content creators is massively imbalanced.

On Web3, your data lives on the blockchain. When you decide to leave a platform, you can take your reputation with you, plugging it into another interface that more clearly aligns with your values.

Web 2.0 requires content creators to trust platforms not to change the rules, but censorship resistance is native feature of a Web3 platform.

### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
As well as owning your data in Web3, you can own the platform as a collective, using tokens that act like shares in a company. [[DAO|DAOs]] let you coordinate decentralized ownership of a platform and make decisions about its future.

## Web3 Limitations
---
### Accessibility
The relative cost of transactions is still prohibitive to many. Web3 is less likely to be utilized in less-wealthy, developing nations due to high transaction fees.
### User Experience
The technology barrier to using Web3 is currently too high. Users must comprehend security concerns, understand complex technical documents, and navigate unintuitive user interfaces. 
[Wallet providers](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/), in particular, are working to solve this, but more progress is needed before Web3 gets adopted en masse.
### Education
### Centralized Infrastructure
Web3 currently depends mainly on centralized infrastructure (GitHub, Twitter, Discord, etc.). Many Web3 companies are rushing to fill these gaps, but building high-quality, reliable infrastructure takes time.
