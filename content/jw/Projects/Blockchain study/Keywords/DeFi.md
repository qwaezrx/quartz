| __DeFi__                                                                                          | __Traditional Finance__                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You hold your money                                                                               | Your money is held by companies                                                          |
| You control where your money goes and how it's spent                                              | You have to trust companies not to mismanage your money, like lending to risky borrowers |
| Transfers of funds happens in minutes                                                             | Payments can take days due to manual processes                                           |
| Transaction activity is pseudonymous                                                              | Financial activity is tightly coupled with your identity                                 |
| DeFi is open to anyone                                                                            | You must apply to use financial services                                                 |
| The markets are always open                                                                       | Markets close because employees need breaks                                              |
| It's built on transparency - anyone can look at a product's data and inspect how the system works | Financial institutions are closed books: you can't ask to see their loan history, a record of their managed assets, and so on.                                                                                         |
