_NFTs_ are tokens that are individually unique. Each NFT has different properties (__non-fungible__) and is provably scarce. This is different from tokens such as [[ETH]] or other Ethereum tokens like USDC where every token is identical and has the same properties ('__fungible__').

The uniqueness of each NFT enables tokenization of things like art, collectibles, or even real estate, where one specific unique NFT represents some specific unique NFT represents some specific unique real world or digital item. Ownership of an asset is publicly verifiable on Ethereum blockchain.

## What are NFTs used for?
---
NFTs are used for many things, including:
- proving that you attended an event
- certify that you completed a course
- ownable items for games
- digital art
- tokenizing real-world assets
- proving your online identity
- gating access to content
- ticketing
- decentralized internet domain names
- collateral in [[DeFi]]

## How do NFTs work?
---
NFTs, like any digital items on the Ethereum blockchain, are created through a special Ethereum based computer program called a [[Smart Contract]]. These contracts follow certain rules, like the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards, which determine what the contract can do.

The NFT smart contract can do a few key things:
- __Create NFTs__: It can make new NFTs
- __Assign Ownership__: It keeps track of who owns which NFTs by linking them to specific Ethereum addresses.
- __Give Each NFT an ID__: Each NFT has a number that makes it unique. Additionally, there's usually some information (metadata) attached to it, describing what the NFT represents.

When someone "__creates__" or "__mints__" an NFT, they're basically telling the smart contract to give them ownership of a particular NFT. This information is securely and publicly stored in the blockchain.

Furthermore, the creator of the contract can add extra rules. They might limit how many of a certain NFT can be made or decide that they should get a small royality fee whenever the NFT changes hands.
