Gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the [[Ethereum]] network.

Since each Ethereum transaction requires computational resources to execute, those resources have to be paid for to ensure Ethereum is not vulnerable to spam and cannot get stuck in infinite computational loops. Payment for computation is made in the form of a _gas fee_.

The gas fee is __the amount of gas used to do some operation, multiplied by the cost per unit gas__. The fee is paid regardless of whether a transaction succeeds or fails.

Gas fees have to be paid in Ethereum's native currency, [[ETH]]. Gas prices are usually quoted in gwei, which is a denomination of ETH. Each gwei is equal to one-billionth of an ETH (10^-9 ETH).
