## Introduction
- Linux is a family of [[Unix]]-like [[OS|operating system]]s
	- Usually specific distribution
- Originally developed as an effort to create a free, open-source Unix OS
- Programmed with [[C]], [[Assembly]]

### Linux Features
- Free and open source
- Secure
- Multi-user
- Multitasking
- Portability

### Linux Beginnings
- `1980s`: [[GNU]] developed at MIT
- `1991`: Linus Torvalds developed a free, open source version of [[Unix]] [[Kernel]] 
- `1992`: Linux OS born via GNU+Linux kernel
- `1996`: Tux
- `Today(2020s)`:
	- BSD-based macOS runs on millions of devices
	- Billions of Linux instances run on servers, serving the modern web
	- Modern Linux OSs are gaining popularity for PCs

### Linux Use Cases
- [[Android]]
- Supercomputers
- Data centers and cloud services
- PCs

## Linux Distributions
Linux distribution:
- is a specific flavor of Linux OS
- also referred to as _Distro_
- Linux kernel is the core component
- There are hundreds of them

### Linux Distro Differences
- System utilities
- GUI
- Shell commands
- Support types:
	- Community versus enterprise
	- Long-term support (LTS) versus rolling release

### Linux Distros
- [[Debian]]: Highly used in servers
- [[Ubuntu]]
- [[Red Had Linux]]
- [[Fedora]]
- [[SLE]]
- [[Arch]]

## Linux Architecture
### Five Layers of Linux
1. [[UI]]
2. [[Application]]
3. [[OS|Operating System]]
4. [[Kernel]]
5. [[Hardware]]

### Linux filesystem
- Collection of files in your machine
- Begins at root directory(/)
- Tree-like structure
- Assigns appropriate access rights

- `/`
	- `/bin`: contains user [[Binary File|binary files]]
	- `/usr`: contains user programs
	- `/home`: personal working directory
	- `/boot`: contains system boot files
		- The instructions vital for system startup
	- `/media`: contains files related to temporary media such as CD or USB drives that are connected to the system

## Linux Terminal

- [[Terminal]] is a powerful way to run applications and interact with your machine.
- [[Linux Basic Commands]]
## Linux Technologies
### Linux process
- Each Linux process has its own memory address space separate from all others and Linux processes.
- Can be rapidly created and destroyed
### Linux cgroups
### Linux namespaces

### Union file systems
