Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these five equally important traits:
1. Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service
2. Customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere
3. The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool
4. Resources are elastic-which means they're flexible, so customers can be
5. Customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go
