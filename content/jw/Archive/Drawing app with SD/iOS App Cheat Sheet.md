## AppDelegate
The app delegate is effectively the foundation of an app and manages some interactions with the system

## SceneDelegate
Starting from iOS 13 and later, SceneDelegate takes some responsibilities from AppDelegate. SceneDelegate is responsible for what's displayed on the screen in terms of user interface (UI) and data.

## ViewControllers

>[!note]
>Each __ViewController__ is one screen of the app

ViewControllers present content user can interact with on the screen. These are the only components that deliver interactive content to the user. A ViewController represents something an application can do, and an application often "does" several things - meaning, most applications provide more than one ViewController.

## UIViews
In iOS, UIViews are almost indivisible elements that draw themselves to the screen. They can display images, text and more. A combination of all these views forms a design interface that serves a purpose for the user.

## Storyboard files
In XCode, each storyboard is represented by a .storyboard file. These user interface files serve as blueprints for the interface that an application presents to the user.

## Project files
Xcode project files belong to one of three main categories: configuration, code, and resource. Configuration files define the project structure, code files provide the logic, and resource files are pretty much everything else.
